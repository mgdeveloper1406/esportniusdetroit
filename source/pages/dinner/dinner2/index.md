Ingredients:

1 pound of ground turkey
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
2 teaspoons of ground cumin
1 teaspoon of paprika
1/2 teaspoon of chili powder
1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
1 can (14.5 ounces) of diced tomatoes, undrained
1 can (15 ounces) of black beans, drained and rinsed
Salt-free seasoning blend (to taste)
Directions:

Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

Add the ground turkey and cook until browned.

Add the onion and garlic to the saucepan and cook until the onion is translucent.

Add the sweet potatoes, ground cumin, paprika, chili powder, and cayenne pepper to the saucepan.

Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Add the diced tomatoes (undrained) to the saucepan and bring to a simmer.

Cover the saucepan and cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
