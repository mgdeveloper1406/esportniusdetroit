Ingredients:

4 bell peppers, halved and seeded
1 cup of cooked quinoa
1 can of low-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed
1 can of diced tomatoes, drained
1/2 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon of ground cumin
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika
Salt-free seasoning blend (to taste)
1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro
Directions:

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, chopped onion, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and salt-free seasoning blend.

Spoon the quinoa mixture into the bell pepper halves.

Place the stuffed bell peppers in a baking dish and cover with foil.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until the bell peppers are tender.

Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and serve hot.
