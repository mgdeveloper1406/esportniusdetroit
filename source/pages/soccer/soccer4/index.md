It has been a quiet January transfer window so far for Premier League clubs, but expect the speed of business to ramp up as we approach deadline day.

This transfer window is the last chance for clubs to strengthen their squads before the end of the season, with matters complicated by the number of players on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup.

Clubs also have to be wary of the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, with Nottingham Forest and Everton waiting to discover if they will face charges. Everton have already been punished with a 10-point deduction for a separate breach.

That is one reason why a number of academy products, such as Chelsea’s Conor Gallagher, have been touted as possible sales, with clubs looking to balance the books.

One factor which could encourage business is this summer’s European Championship, with internationals knowing their squad place could be at risk if they are not playing regular football.

When is transfer deadline day?
Thursday February 1.

What time does the window close in England?
The window shuts for English clubs at 11pm.

What time does the window close for La Liga and Bundesliga clubs?
Spain’s window ends at the same time but French teams have an hour less to complete deals with a 10pm deadline. The German window closes at the end of the working day, at 5pm, while transfers in Italy must be completed by 7pm.

Saudi Arabia are also open for business having spent £750 million in one window last summer. Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo told Sky Sports they are “not shying away” from trying to recruit more big-name European players.

What is each club looking for?
We assess the priorities of every Premier League club in this extensive guide to the window. Strikers are in high demand, but short supply, while numerous clubs are exploring short-term deals to keep their powder dry for primary targets in the summer.

How can I watch transfer deadline day?
There is not a great deal to watch, and Sky Sports News has rather lost its monopoly on the day’s events.
