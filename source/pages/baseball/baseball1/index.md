DREAM Series participants living MLK's legacy of brotherhood, unity

Carson Ray grew up in Atlanta, the birthplace and final resting place of one of America’s most influential historical figures, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Ray, a 16-year-old right-hander and one of more than 80 predominantly Black elite high school athletes invited to the 2024 DREAM Series, has always been intimately familiar with Dr. King’s legacy.

Ray’s grandfather, Charles Steele Jr., is the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), an African American civil rights organization based in Atlanta. Its first president was none other than Dr. King himself.

In January 1957, following the famous Montgomery bus boycott victory, Dr. King gathered a group of fellow Black church leaders to create an organization that would coordinate and support nonviolent efforts to desegregate bus systems all over the South. They would soon decide to expand the organization’s focus to ending all forms of segregation.

Steele made sure his grandson knew all about Dr. King’s life of service and impact on the nation.

“I learned a lot,” Ray said. “Where he used to grow up, how he used to do things, how he used to think. And the way my grandfather thinks, it’s kind of more like him, because he has to -- he was once in his position, so he has to think more like him. It’s a lot. And I’m blessed to be able to experience it.”
