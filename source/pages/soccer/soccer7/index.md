The Kansas City Comets moved to 6-1 on the season after two victories over the St. Louis Ambush in a home-and-home series to conclude 2023. The Comets were not at their best in either matchup but had enough to come from behind to win both games. 

They were aided by big performances from John Sosa and Zach Reget. A crowd of 5,313 was on hand at Cable Dahmer Arena to see the Comets defeat the Ambush 6-4 on Thursday, December 28. After conceding a goal 21 seconds in, the Comets eventually settled into the game to take a 3-2 lead at halftime.


Sosa was Thursday’s top star as the veteran defender tallied three goals and an assist. Despite being under the weather, Sosa’s brilliance was on full display for MASL’s attendance-leading venue for the second straight season. Many of the Comets faithful also made the cross-state trip for Sunday’s New Year’s Eve matchup, as the Comets defeated the Ambush 6-5 at the Family Arena in St. Charles, Missouri. The Ambush came out strong in the first quarter and grabbed a 2-0 lead. The Comets managed to level the score 2-2 before halftime and erupted for a four-goal third period, but their lead shrunk to 6-4 after conceding a couple of power-play goals.

“I think the third quarter was amazing,” Stokic continued. “We came out, not just by scoring the goals, but just the way we played. The blue cards hurt us; if we take away the blue cards, this game would have been different.” The Comets held a 6-4 lead for most of the fourth quarter, but St. Louis made the final moments interesting after scoring with 25 seconds remaining. The Ambush were given a dangerous top-of-the-arc restart with 0.8 seconds left, but the direct shot missed wide as the Comets held on for the win.
