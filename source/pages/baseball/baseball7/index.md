The Royals reportedly signed Cuban third baseman Jose Cerice as well. KC is expected to ink deals with international prospects Darison Garcia, Anderson Garcia and Juan Rivera, per Baseball America. The three each hail from the Dominican Republic. 

Additionally, the Royals are set to sign deals with Jhonayker Ugarte, Anthony Longo and Robinson Chacon out of Venezuela, per Baseball America. The MLB international signing period runs through Dec. 15. Teams are permitted to sign prospects throughout the year. T
