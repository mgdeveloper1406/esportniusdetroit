Ingredients:

1 cup quinoa, rinsed

2 cups water or vegetable broth

1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved

1 cucumber, diced

1 bell pepper, diced

1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped

1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped

1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

2 tablespoons lemon juice

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder

Salt and black pepper to taste

Optional additions: avocado slices, cooked chickpeas, feta cheese


Directions:

In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa and water or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat

 to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. 

Remove from heat and let it cool.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, parsley,

 and cilantro.
In a small bowl, whisk together the extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, ground cumin, turmeric powder, salt,

and black pepper to make the dressing.

Pour the dressing over the quinoa salad and toss until everything is well coated.

Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.

If desired, add optional additions like avocado slices, cooked chickpeas, or feta cheese.

Serve the anti-inflammatory quinoa salad immediately or chill it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours 
before serving to allow the flavors to meld.

Enjoy your nutritious and delicious anti-inflammatory lunch!
