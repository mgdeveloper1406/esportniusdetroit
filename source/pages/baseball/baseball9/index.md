The Kansas City Royals agreed to terms with four arbitration-eligible players on Thursday. KC signed pitchers Brady Singer, Carlos Hernandez, Nick Anderson and Kyle Wright to one-year contracts. The Royals will not head to arbitration hearings with any player this season. Royals pitchers Josh Taylor and Kris Bubic agreed to one-year deals earlier this offseason. Singer will reportedly make $4.85 million in 2024. Meanwhile, Hernandez is set to earn $1.0125 million. 

The Royals acquired Wright and Anderson from the Atlanta Braves. They will reportedly make $1.8 million and $1.575 million, respectively, per MLB.com reporter Anne Rogers. Major League Baseball teams had until Thursday’s arbitration deadline to exchange salary figures with arbitration-eligible players. The Royals continued to finalize their spring training roster this week. The club invited 23 non-roster players to their looming major-league camp on Wednesday. The group includes a mix of major-league veterans and top prospects. Singer, 27, is hoping for rebound this season. He posted a 5.52 ERA in 29 starts during the 2023 campaign. Singer is expected to operate as the No. 4 starter in the Royals’ starting rotation following the additions of Seth Lugo and Michael Wacha. 

Hernandez is slated to fill a key bullpen role. He posted a 5.27 ERA, 77 strikeouts and four saves in 70 innings last season. Hernandez has a dynamic fastball but struggled with his command. He has an opportunity to earn a high-leverage role in a revamped bullpen that includes veterans Anderson, Will Smith and Chris Stratton. Anderson had a strong 2023 season with the Braves. He is an experienced reliever who can pitch in a late-innings role. Wright is expected to miss the 2024 campaign after undergoing shoulder surgery. The Royals maintain team control on each player. 

Singer and Wright will not reach unrestricted free agency until the 2027 season. Anderson won’t hit free agency until 2026 and Hernandez has three years of arbitration eligibility remaining. The Royals will head to Surprise, Arizona for spring training next month. Pitchers and catchers report on Feb. 14 and the team’s first full-squad workout will be Feb. 19.
