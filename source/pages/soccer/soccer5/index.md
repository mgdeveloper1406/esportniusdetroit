The modern Manchester City have a tradition of dramatic 3-2 comeback victories in title-winning campaigns. Oscar Bobb’s decider did not have the finality of Sergio Aguero and Ilkay Gundogan’s last-day goals but it may help City win more than just a thriller at St James’ Park. Yet the immediate significance may have been for Newcastle United.

Eleven points off fourth, with a double-digit distance to fifth, Newcastle’s return to the Champions League this year will not be a one-off but nor will it contain a sequel next season. A club with grand ambitions but a realistic trajectory aimed for a top-six finish this season. Now they are 10th and, by the time this round of fixtures ends next week, they could be eight points adrift of sixth. The trophy drought on Tyneside famously dates back to the 1960s: now there is an added onus to end it, with the FA Cup potentially offering the Magpies’ best chance of European football next year.

The simplistic explanation for their slide may be that Newcastle are suffering from their version of second-season syndrome, a reaction to the overachievement of the previous campaign. Yet the manner of City’s triumph felt cruelly familiar, with the cocktail of late goals involving substitutes that Newcastle had seen before: against AC Milan, Chelsea and Liverpool. And, while there is nothing novel in citing Newcastle’s debilitating injury problems, it illustrates their pertinence in a sequence of eight defeats in 10 games.

“We’ve seen it so many times ourselves this season, you bring on an attacking sub and suddenly your team dynamic looks totally different,” manager Eddie Howe reflected. “We’ve got some incredible athletes missing at the moment that would have given us another gear or couple of gears.”

The reference to physicality was no coincidence: by preference, Newcastle play at eviscerating speed. There was a sense that Howe’s gameplan this season, especially with the more crowded fixture list, was to use some of his players as finishers: not so much in the sense that Alan Shearer was one, but in the way the former England rugby coach Eddie Jones deployed the term, as specialist substitutes. In particular, the all-action duo of Anthony Gordon and Miguel Almiron looked designed to be replaced after 70 minutes: without Harvey Barnes and Jacob Murphy, who have not played for three-and-a-half and two months respectively, that option is gone. Newcastle lose attacking threat and then concede.

The cost of Sandro Tonali’s ban can be measured in many ways: one is simply that, were the Italian available, then Sean Longstaff and Lewis Miley could have been the cavalry more often, sent on to see out games, rather than always starting and finishing them. Newcastle have often had defenders on the bench, but not midfielders and forwards. “We’re missing a lot of players from the same position,” Howe rued.
