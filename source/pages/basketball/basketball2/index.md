The Sixers on Sunday officially listed Joel Embiid as questionable to return for their Monday afternoon matchup vs. the Rockets.

After missing the team’s past three games with a left knee injury, Embiid practiced on Sunday. He also played 3-on-3 with assistant coaches and player development staffers.

The Sixers ruled out De’Anthony Melton (lumbar spine stress response) and Robert Covington (left knee inflammation). They listed Mo Bamba (right knee fat pad impingement) as doubtful.

Melton had sat out the Sixers’ first three games of January with a “lumbar spine soreness” designation. He played the past two games on a minutes restriction that the team aimed to gradually loosen. Melton had a 25-minute outing Friday night in the Sixers’ win over the Kings and posted six points on 2-for-9 shooting, four rebounds and three assists.

Covington’s absence will be the 33-year-old forward’s sixth straight.

“It’s just kind of coming and going with the swelling,” Nurse said. “One day it does, one day it doesn’t. The days it doesn’t, you’re hopeful. And the days it does, you’ve just got to go back to the drawing board. So we’re still trying to work through that.”

Kelly Oubre Jr. practiced Sunday and wasn’t on the Sixers’ injury report. He’d been sidelined vs. Sacramento with a right big toe injury that Nurse said “kind of flamed up” during Oubre’s pregame workout.

Paul Reed remains the one Sixer who’s played in every game this season. The 24-year-old didn’t have a big scoring night against the Kings (eight points on 3-for-9 shooting), but the Sixers were pleased with his many other contributions.

Over 24 minutes, Reed tallied five offensive rebounds, three blocks, two steals, two assists and zero turnovers.

“I told P-Reed, ‘Listen, I’ve been with you for three years and I’ve seen you go get every offensive rebound, go get every defensive rebound, block every shot, get steals,” Tyrese Maxey said Friday. “I want you to get back to that, because that’s who you are.’

“That’s just a conversation you can have with somebody when you have a good relationship with them. Our relationship is strong, and he told me he got me. He was extremely aggressive tonight.”
