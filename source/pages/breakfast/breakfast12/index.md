Ingredients:


1/2 cup rolled oats

1 cup milk (almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk)

1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder

1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds

1/2 cup mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, etc.)

1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional, for sweetness)

Sliced almonds or walnuts for topping (optional)


Directions:

In a small saucepan, combine the rolled oats, milk, turmeric, and cinnamon.

Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the oats are cooked and the mixture has a creamy consistency.


Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the ground flaxseeds until well incorporated.

Pour the oatmeal into a serving bowl.

Top the oatmeal with the mixed berries.

If desired, drizzle with honey or maple syrup for sweetness.


Optional: Sprinkle sliced almonds or walnuts on top for extra crunch and nutrition.


Enjoy your nutritious and anti-inflammatory breakfast bowl!

This breakfast bowl is still packed with anti-inflammatory ingredients like turmeric, cinnamon, and flaxseeds,
 but it doesn't include chia seeds. Enjoy!
