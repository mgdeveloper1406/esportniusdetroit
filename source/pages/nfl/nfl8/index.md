A former three-star recruit out of Amos P. Godby High School in Tallahassee, Florida, where he was the 267th Floridian recruit and the 137th OLB in the 2019 recruiting cycle. Solomon was a very accomplished EDGE rusher in the smaller Sun Belt conference. He was Honorable Mention All-Sun Belt or better since the 2020 season He had 46 pressures on 336 pass-rushing reps in 2023. In 2021, Solomon was an All-American Honorable Mention by Pro Football Network; he averaged 1.42 tackles per loss per game and averaged just under a sack a game. Solomon became one of just 31 players nationally since 2000 to record 17 tackles for loss and 11 sacks through the first ten games of a season; one of just nine from a Group of Five school to do so and the only Sun Belt player. He joined the ranks as the third player since at least 2000 to record 12 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks, and one interception in the season's first six games. The other two were Carl Nassib (Penn State, 2015), and Elvis Dumervil (Louisville, 2005) Solomon will attend the 2024 Reese’s Senior Bowl.

Excellent athlete with impressive burst and quickness 

Exceptional first step maximizes ability to win high-side 

A high-side rusher with elite lower-body flexion

Balanced player with a low center of gravity 

Great foot control, change of direction, and agility Evasive chest with reduced surface area due to stature Does not have a large target for tackles to strike 

Does a great job bending through contact at the top of the pass-rushing arc Good hand usage to land the rip and bend 

Flashed a long-arm to set up secondary moves Does string pass rush moves together 

Hump move vs. Arkansas State showed exceptional leveral, control, and solid strength 

Turns a tight corner to get his hips oriented into the pocket Leveraged different moves at the top of pass rushing arc to win 

Flashed inside counter moves to expose over-aggressive tackles Can convert speed-to-power (at lower level of competition) Unlocks good power through the ground with his lean into contact 

Maintains a low profile with his power rush to generate force on contact 

Quickness is evident on games/twists Was in a penetrating system that gave him the freedom to attack upfield as a run defender 

Slippery to block, does well to reduce his target area and combines that with his short-area-quickness to evade Has rushed from a variety of alignments and stances (FROG, two/three point) 

Huge hits on tape Motor is great
