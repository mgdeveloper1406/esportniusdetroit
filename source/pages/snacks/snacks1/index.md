Roasted Chickpeas
Ingredients:

1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
Salt and pepper (to taste)
Directions:

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.

Pat the chickpeas dry with a paper towel and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Drizzle the chickpeas with olive oil and sprinkle with smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

Toss the chickpeas until they are evenly coated with the seasonings.

Roast the chickpeas in the oven for 20-30 minutes, or until crispy.

Serve the roasted chickpeas as a crunchy and satisfying snack.
