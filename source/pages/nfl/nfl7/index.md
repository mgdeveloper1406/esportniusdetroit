Sporting Kansas City announced on Sunday the club's schedule and roster for the 2024 preseason presented by Children's Mercy Kansas City.

The team kicked off preseason training tonight in Miami Shores, Fla., where the club will be based from Jan. 14-31 and will return from Feb. 4-17 in preparation for the upcoming Major League Soccer season. Sporting's preseason schedule is slated to feature five closed-door scrimmages as Sporting plays three MLS clubs, local USL Championship side Miami FC and NCAA Division I school Florida International University. For live coverage of the club's five preseason exhibitions, fans can follow @SKCMatchday on Twitter.

Sporting’s preseason roster will feature 25 of the club’s 26 players under MLS contract for the 2024 season, including newcomers Zorhan Bassong and Alenis Vargas. Left back Logan Ndenbe will not travel to Florida as he continues to rehab from a torn ACL suffered during the Audi 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs.

The preseason squad will also include three Sporting KC II players—Ethan Bryant, Nati Clarke and Sebastian Cruz—as well as trialist Jacori Hayes, unsigned MLS SuperDraft picks Jonathan Robinson and Ryan Schewe, and Sporting KC Academy trio Jacob Bartlett, Jack Kortkamp and Cielo Tschantret.

Sporting Kansas City will kick off the 2024 regular season on the road at reigning U.S. Open Cup champions Houston Dynamo FC on Feb. 24 with the earliest MLS match in club history. One week later, Sporting will host perennial Eastern Conference powers Philadelphia Union for the club's highly anticipated home opener on March 2 at Children's Mercy Park.
