Blueberry Chia Seed Pudding
Ingredients:

1/2 cup of fresh blueberries

1 tablespoon of honey
Directions:

In a blender, blend the fresh blueberries and unsweetened almond milk until smooth.

Pour the blueberry mixture into a bowl.

Stir in the chia seeds and honey.

Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and forms a pudding-like consistency.

Serve chilled
