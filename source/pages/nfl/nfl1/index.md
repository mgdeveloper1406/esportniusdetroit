DETROIT — The roar was primal. It was visceral. It was generational. It felt like it couldn’t get louder, and then it did. It felt like it couldn’t last, and then it never waned. It rattled the beams of Ford Field and poured out of television sets across the country.

It was loud, of course. More than 66,000 screaming Detroit Lions fans inside a roofed stadium downtown. That doesn’t count the millions more in crowded bars or living room watch parties or even alone, pacing in nervous panic, at least until head coach Dan Campbell called for victory formation, the scoreboard secure at Lions 24, Rams 23.

But this was about more than traditional crowd noise — whether designed to distract or celebrate — because this was more than just an NFL wild-card game. It was the roar that some waited 32 seasons to deliver while surely many others had lost hope that it would ever arrive.

It came from the depths of so many lost seasons and so many lost chances; lost chances at what they were now, at last, experiencing. So often across the decades, it didn’t even feel like Detroit had an NFL team, at least not in anything but a supporting role.
