A Golden State Warriors team in desperate need of a boost is about to get one â€” Draymond Green is expected to return to the court Monday.

The Warriors went 7-9 overall in those 16 games without Green and are 3-7 in their last 10 with the worst defense in the NBA over that stretch. Green will instantly help on that end as a communicator and quarterback of the defense, plus he can still defend multiple positions. Golden State can also use his passing and secondary playmaking in the pick-and-roll with Stephen Curry.

The Warriors, 18-21, sit 12th in the West 2.5 games behind the No. 10 seed and the final play-in spot.

This is a soft entry for Green, injuries have ravaged the Grizzlies and will be without Ja Morant, Marcus Smart, Desmond Bane, Derrick Rose, Steven Adams and Brandon Clarke.
