Legendary goaltender Patrick Roy has already crafted a legacy as one of hockey’s all-time great competitors, both as a player and as a coach. And recent rumors have suggested Roy is waiting for the right job offer to return to the NHL as a bench boss. QMJHL play-by-play announcer Ray Cloutier said on Quebec City French radio show Dupont Le Matin that Roy had already rejected two different coaching offers from Western Conference teams. 

Cloutier added he thinks the increased travel that goes along with being a team in the West had a factor as well as potentially taking a sabbatical year. But perhaps Roy knows something the hockey world at large doesn’t know. 

Maybe he wants to be focused and ready when the perfect opportunity becomes available. For most people in Roy’s position, that perfect job is probably coaching the Montreal Canadiens. But given that Martin St-Louis has a firm hold on that position, the Habs aren’t going to be employing Roy anytime soon.
