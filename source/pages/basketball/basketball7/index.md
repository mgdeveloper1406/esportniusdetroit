Baylor and Texas Tech are the only men’s basketball teams in the Big 12 Conference with perfect records after the first three games of the marathon 18-game league schedule. As much as Kansas coach Bill Self respects the 3-0 Bears and 3-0 Red Raiders, “I don’t think anybody is going to run the table,” the Jayhawks’ 21st-year leader said before a 78-66 victory over Oklahoma (1-2) on Saturday at Allen Fieldhouse.

That victory upped KU’s league record to 2-1, same mark as Kansas State, TCU and Iowa State heading into a week that sends KU to Oklahoma State (0-3) on Tuesday for an 8 p.m. tip and West Virginia (1-2) for a 3 p.m. Central contest on Saturday. 

“The next two games are monsters,” Self said. “The way we’ve always done it, we break our season down into weeks. We didn’t have a good week (last week). We lost at Central Florida (1-2). We didn’t do ourselves any favors. “What we do this particular upcoming week is big. You go 2-0 this week you are right where you should be. You go 1-1 you are looking uphill. 

You go 0-2 it’s a big climb. This is a big, big week for us. Not very often do you go into the second week of an 18-game schedule thinking, ‘Gosh, these are must win games.’ I think there are some people who feel that way.” The Jayhawks (14-2), ranked No. 3 in the AP poll for a second straight week, on Tuesday take on (8-8) Oklahoma State in Gallagher-Iba Arena.

The Cowboys had travel problems involving both of their games last week. Extreme wind gusts prevented the Cowboys from making it to Lubbock, Texas on Monday, the day before their game against Texas Tech. They traveled the day of the game and were blown out by the Red Raiders, 90-73. Then the Cowboys had travel woes that delayed the start of their 66-42 loss at Iowa State on Saturday. Heavy snow shut down airports in Oklahoma on Friday. The Cowboys left Stillwater via bus at 6 a.m. Saturday (the game was initially set for 5 p.m. Saturday) for the Oklahoma City airport where their charter plane was grounded because of mechanical problems.
