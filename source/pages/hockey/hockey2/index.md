With Central Scouting releasing its mid-term rankings and the world juniors complete, the prospect schedule moved on to Michigan, where the 2024 All-American prospects game took place. 

This year's rosters are once again made up of talent from the USHL and USA Hockey's National Team Development Program, but a couple of non-Americans such as Canada's Sacha Boisvert and Russia's Matvei Gridin were included. The majority of players are eligible for the 2024 NHL draft, but a couple of high-end kids for 2025 - such as James Hagens and Logan Hensler of the NTDP - were also here. The following is a list of the players who stood out the most to me in this all-star prospect game, starting with the 2024 prospects: 

John Mustard, RW, Waterloo: Great speed and power when he has the puck. Mustard's stock has definitely been rising throughout the year and he's been great for the Black Hawks with 31 points through 29 games. His offensive abilities were on full display at the AAPG and he had the game-winner in OT. He's a Providence College commit. 

E.J. Emery, D, U.S. NTDP: He's got a great frame and mobility, making him an ideal candidate to be a new-school defensive defender. 

But the University of North Dakota also got on the scoresheet with a goal when he jumped up in the rush and potted in a James Hagens rebound. So don't count out his offensive upside, either. 

Cole Eiserman, LW, U.S. NTDP: Sorry, but I don't buy the 'one-dimensional' knock on Eiserman. Yes, he's a high-volume shooter who loves to score goals, but he can also set up his linemates. The Boston University commit can really motor and he gets his shot off fast. And yes, he scored a goal. 

Trevor Connelly, LW, Tri-City: The skills are obvious with Connelly. Nice edgework and puckhandling. Nice speed, too, plus he's creative. The Providence College commit is one of the top scorers in the USHL with 35 points through 25 games. 

Will Skahan, D, U.S. NTDP: I like Skahan the most on the defensive side of things, especially his physicality - he even smoked NTDP teammate Teddy Stiga with a huge hit behind the net in the first period. He can get in trouble when he tries to do too much with the puck, but the frame and upside of the Boston College commit are impossible to ignore. 

Will Felicio, D, Waterloo: Great skater, closes on puck carriers fast and recovers well on defense. Very much a new-school undersized defenseman. Felicio was recently traded from Madison to Waterloo; he's a University of Denver commit. 

Max Plante, RW, U.S. NTDP: Dogged forechecker who drew a penalty in the first period thanks to his compete level. Not a big player, but certainly makes an impact on most shifts. Plante is a University of Minnesota-Duluth commit and he'll fit right in with the Bulldogs. 

James Reeder, RW, Dubuque: Sometimes you can't necessarily put a finger on why a player is effective; they just are. Reeder had a couple points early and has a nice overall skill set. He's not big, but he gets the job done. He's another University of Denver commit. 

Teddy Stiga, LW, U.S. NTDP: Waterbug type of player with a lot of high-skill elements; Stiga makes some very neat little plays with the puck. Had a nice goal in the third period, rewarding him for a pretty solid night overall. He's a Boston College commit. 

Sacha Boisvert, C, Muskegon: Great hand-eye co-ordination, fights for pucks. Had a really nice rush in the third period where he built up a great head of steam and cruised up the ice. Boisvert is a University of North Dakota commit with nice size. 2025 L

ogan Hensler, D, U.S. NTDP: Dang, this kid has wheels. I had heard hype about Hensler dating back to last season and I can understand why. He's a University of Wisconsin commit and brings nice size along with his mobility and puckhandling. 

James Hagens, C, U.S. NTDP: Quite possibly the No. 1 pick in 2025, Hagens has already proven over a broad sample size that he's an incredibly effective offensive weapon. It was more of the same here at the AAPG, where the Boston College commit got his on the scoresheet. 

Shane Vansaghi, RW, U.S. NTDP: There is some serious power forward potential in Vansaghi, who blends size, speed, skill and physicality. What more can you ask for? The Michigan State commit looked very dangerous.
