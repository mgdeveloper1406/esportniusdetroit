The stakes are getting bigger.

Super Wild Card Weekend is almost complete, with two more games Monday to round things out.

On Saturday, the AFC's No. 4-seeded Houston Texans cruised past the No. 5 seed Cleveland Browns 45-14 before the No. 3-seeded Kansas City Chiefs handled the No. 6 seed Miami Dolphins 26-7 that night.

Then on Sunday, the NFC's No. 7-seeded Green Bay Packers stunned the No. 2 seed Dallas Cowboys 48-32 before the No. 3 seed Detroit Lions ended a 32-year playoff-win drought by beating the No. 6 seed Los Angeles Rams 24-23.
