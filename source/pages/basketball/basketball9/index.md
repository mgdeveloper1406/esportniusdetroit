The No. 3-ranked University of Kansas men’s basketball team will travel to Stillwater to face Oklahoma State on Tuesday. The Jayhawks (14-2, 2-1 Big 12) beat Oklahoma on Saturday. Meanwhile, OSU lost to Iowa State. Kansas has a 123-60 record against the Cowboys all-time. Below is a scouting report and prediction of the game. NO. 3 KANSAS VS. OKLAHOMA STATE When/where: 8 p.m., Gallagher-Iba Arena (Stillwater, Oklahoma) TV/streaming: ESPN Opponent’s record: 8-8, 0-3 Big 12 KenPom (Ken Pomeroy) Ranking: 108 Betting line: Kansas is a 7.5-point favorite All statistics are from KenPom.com, Hoop-Math.com and EvanMiya. KenPom stats only include Division I competition. 

OSU TEAM STRENGTHS 

Effective defense: The Cowboys rank No. 76 (99.9) in adjusted defensive efficiency, the number of points a team allows per 100 possessions, adjusted for opponent. By comparison, Kansas ranks No. 11 in the same category. Quality shots: OSU ranks No. 56 in effective field goal percentage (53.6). Sharpshooting: Oklahoma State ranks No. 62 in 3-point percentage (36.2%). 

OSU TEAM WEAKNESSES 

Can’t draw fouls: Oklahoma State struggles to draw shooting fouls, ranking No. 284 in free throw rate (28.5). Weak schedule: OSU hasn’t played too many tough opponents, with a strength of schedule that ranks No. 209. Meanwhile, KU’s SOS is No. 28. Turnover galore: Oklahoma State struggles to take care of the ball, ranking No. 305 in turnover percentage (19.9). 

OSU NAME TO KNOW 

6–foot-3 junior guard Javon Small (No. 12) + Leading scorer (14.8 ppg) + Quality rebounder (5.1 rebounds per game) + Makes foul shots (shooting 87.7% at the line) + Sharpshooter (shooting 40.5% from 3-point range) + Quality passer (4.3 APG) - Turnover prone (2.5 turnovers per game) TALE OF THE TAPE

Oklahoma State not only does an excellent job of finding quality shots, but OSU ranks No. 54 in assist rate. Here, OSU doesn’t rush and lets the play develop, leading to an open 3-pointer. For the Jayhawks, it’ll be important to call out screens and make sure to keep an eye out for OSU shooters that are constantly moving. 

GAME PREDICTION 

This game marks the start of a week on the road for the Jayhawks. KU needs to focus on forcing a turnover-prone Cowboys team into making mistakes and capitalizing on that. On the offensive end, Kansas must play like it did against OU by limiting turnovers and taking quality shots. 

Although OSU is a bottom-tier conference team, there’s rarely an easy conference game in the Big 12, especially on the road. Still, I think KU will win this one with ease. Kansas 75, OSU 62 Shreyas’ pick to cover the spread: Kansas (-7.5) Shreyas’ season record: 11-3 Shreyas’ record against the spread: 8-6 KU 

PLAYER TO WATCH: 

KJ ADAMS Kansas forward KJ Adams has taken a big step offensively this season. In KU’s last game, the forward had 15 points and eight rebounds in the first half alone. He even hit a jumper or two. After the game, he said he hoped to shoot more jumpers, as he’s starting to feel more comfortable with them. Against OSU, Adams might have the chance to shoot more, especially if the Jayhawks get up big.
