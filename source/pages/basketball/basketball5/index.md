Mike Brown brought the receipts from the Kings' heartbreaking 143-142 overtime loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday night.

Sacramento's coach was ejected in the fourth quarter at Fiserv Forum after appearing to accidentally collide with Milwaukee guard Pat Connaughton while arguing with a referee.

Having missed more than half of the fourth quarter and the entire overtime period, which ended in a Damian Lillard game-winning 3-pointer, Brown had time to gather the evidence and brought to his postgame press conference a laptop with footage of calls he believes went against Sacramento.

Brown proceeded to break down the film with reporters for more than three minutes, and made his points abundantly clear. Although his evidence certainly is compelling, Brown could receive some sort of fine from the NBA for the stunt.

The laptop probably will make another appearance in the Kings' next film session as they look to dissect what went wrong in an attempt to rebound from another frustrating loss, which dropped them to 23-16 and sixth in the Western Conference.
