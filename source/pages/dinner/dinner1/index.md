Grilled Salmon with Quinoa and Roasted Vegetables
Ingredients:

4 salmon fillets
1/4 cup of olive oil
Salt-free seasoning blend (to taste)
1 cup of quinoa
2 cups of water
2 cups of mixed vegetables (such as broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots)
1 tablespoon of olive oil
Directions:

Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.

Brush the salmon fillets with olive oil and season with salt-free seasoning blend.

Grill the salmon fillets for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked through.

In a medium saucepan, bring the quinoa and water to a boil.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed.

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.

Toss the mixed vegetables with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and spread them out on a baking sheet.

Roast the vegetables in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and lightly browned.

Serve the grilled salmon with the quinoa and roasted vegetables.
