The Kansas City Mavericks just wrapped up one of the biggest weeks in their 15-year history, sweeping the defending Western Conference champion Idaho Steelheads on the road. The Mavericks are riding a league-high nine-game win streak and sit at the top of the ECHL standings as they head back to Kansas City for a long home stand. 

The first game of the series on Wednesday was one of the most exciting games of the season — and finished with a 4-3 Mavericks victory in overtime. After having 10 days off between games, the Mavericks fell into a 2-0 hole. But KC began to take control at the end of the first period. 

In his first game since being assigned from the AHL, Jeremy McKenna got the Mavericks on the board with his 101st career ECHL point. The teams went scoreless in the second period, setting up a dramatic end to the game. 

Just 30 seconds into the third period, David Cotton evened the score at two goals apiece. Idaho answered back shortly after to go up 3-2. One of the hottest Mavericks over the last month, Marc-Olivier Duquette scored his third goal of the season to eventually send the game to overtime. 

A back-and-forth extra period went down to the wire before Patrick Curry found the back of the net to give the Mavericks the victory and sole possession of first place in the division. It was Curry’s team-leading fourth game-winning goal of the season. 

Friday’s game in Boise was a near replica of the series’ first game, with the Mavericks being led by the newest additions to the roster. Idaho got off to another quick lead, but Bradley Schoonbaert — the Kansas City rookie from the University of Calgary — scored his first pro goal to answer back. Back-to-back goals from the Steelheads put the Mavericks in a 3-1 hole midway through the second period. 

But that was all the offense Idaho had the rest of the night. Wednesday’s hero — Curry — pulled Kansas City closer heading into the third period. Then, two of the newcomers emerged as Friday night’s stars. Schoonbaert scored his second goal with eight minutes remaining. With time ticking away and a second straight overtime game nearing, Bobby Hampton — acquired in a trade from Wheeling in December — found the net with 34 seconds to play to give Kansas City the 4-3 victory. The Mavericks left a stunned and quiet Idaho Central Arena on Friday night primed for a sweep on Saturday. 

With the series win already in the bag, the Mavericks lit the scoreboard up on Saturday night. Goals came in clumps from both teams, with Kansas City coming out on top, 7-5. Two Mavericks goals from McKenna, along with scores from Hampton, Schoonbaert, Curry, Duquette and Luke Santerno, sent Kansas City back home with a huge victory and nine-game winning streak. The streak is the longest in the ECHL this season and moved Kansas City into first place.
