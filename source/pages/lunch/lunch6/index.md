1 tablespoon of grated ginger
2 cups of chopped spinach
2 cups of cooked chickpeas
1 can of low-sodium diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon of curry powder

Salt and pepper (to taste)
Directions:

Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger to the pot and sauté until fragrant.

Add the chopped spinach to the pot and sauté until wilted.

Add the cooked chickpeas, low-sodium diced tomatoes, curry powder, ground turmeric, salt, and pepper to the pot.
