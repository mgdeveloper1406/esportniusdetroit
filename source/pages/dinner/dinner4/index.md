Turmeric and Ginger Chicken Stir-Fry
Ingredients:

1 pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 tablespoon of olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 zucchini, sliced
1 cup of sliced mushrooms
1 tablespoon of grated ginger
1 tablespoon of ground turmeric
Salt-free seasoning blend (to taste)
2 tablespoons of low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon of honey
1 tablespoon of cornstarch
1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro
Directions:

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.

Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook until the onion is tender.

Add the chicken pieces to the skillet and cook until the chicken is no longer pink.

Add the sliced bell pepper, sliced zucchini, and sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are tender.

Add the grated ginger, ground turmeric, and salt-free seasoning blend to the skillet and stir to combine.

In a small bowl, whisk together the low-sodium soy sauce, honey, and cornstarch.

Pour the soy sauce mixture into the skillet and stir to combine.

Cook until the sauce thickens and everything is heated through.

Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and serve hot.
