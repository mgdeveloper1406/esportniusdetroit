Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin believes Pep Guardiola was "correct" in limiting Kevin de Bruyne to appearing from the bench at Newcastle in his first Premier League appearance since August.

The Belgium international came on in the second half with his side 2-1 down at Newcastle on Saturday and scored a fine equaliser before assisting the winner for Oscar Bobb with an trademark exquisite pass.

"Pep Guardiola was correct not to start De Bruyne," Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. "That first half was mayhem with the pace it was being played at.

"You don't want a player who's just had a hamstring injury who is not fully fit yet, to have to deal with that. Wait until the players tire, then bring him on when there's a bit of space.

"Pep did that and boy does that guy know how to use space.

"His goal was fantastic, not many other players pass it in from 25 yards - they're all too busy trying to smash it or curl it in the top corner. Simple, just pass it in - absolutely beautiful.

"Every time he got the ball, which was almost all the time when he came on, he was doing dangerous things and putting balls into dangerous areas. He was seeing passes others weren't seeing.

"We know how great Bernardo Silva can be, we know how brilliant Foden is, and then you see the king De Bruyne come on. He's just got something else.

"It had been a classic game and it needed a winning goal. That moment where he drops into the pocket, that quarterback pass - it was inch perfect."
