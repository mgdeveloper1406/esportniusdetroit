The NFL play-offs are underway meaning the biggest sports event in the 2024 calendar – Super Bowl LVIII – is fast approaching.

This year’s game takes place in Las Vegas, when millions of eyes from around the world will be fixed on the two teams battling it out for the Vince Lombardi trophy.

We have four playoff rounds to get through before we get to the big game on February 11. Here, Telegraph Sport gives you the rundown on all the key information ahead of Super Bowl LVIII.

When is Super Bowl 2024?
Super Bowl LVIII will be played on Sunday, February 11 2024.

Due to the addition of a game to the NFL regular season, the Super Bowl has been pushed out of its usual slot on the first Sunday in February.

When does Super Bowl 2024 start?
In the UK, this means the kick-off will be at 11.30pm. In the US, the game will start at 3.30pm PST, which is a 6.30pm kick on the east coast.

Due to the Super Bowl being played in Las Vegas, the start will be earlier than usual due to the need for it to fall into the primetime viewing slot on the east coast.

Where is Super Bowl 2024 being played?
For the first time in NFL history the Super Bowl takes place in Las Vegas.

Allegiant Stadium – the home of the Las Vegas Raiders – is the host venue, just three years after it first opened its doors in September 2020.

The stadium cost $1.9 billion to construct and boasts a regular capacity of 65,000. However, that number can expand for big events, meaning the capacity for the Super Bowl will likely exceed 70,000.

How do I watch Super Bowl 2024?
This year sees the start of an updated 11-year contract between the NFL and the four main broadcasters in the US which will see the game pass between each in a rotation.

CBS will be the host broadcaster in the US this year, with the game also being streamed on Paramount+. Jim Nantz and Tony Romo will be the likely commentary duo.

In the UK, Super Bowl LVIII will be broadcast free-to-air on ITV1 and online via ITVX. Paid subscribers of Sky Sports will also get coverage, while TalkSport will cover the game on radio.

Who is performing the half-time show?
After Rihanna’s superb performance at Super Bowl LVII, all eyes will be on another incredible show in Las Vegas.

This year, R&B megastar Usher will be the man trusted to entertain Allegiant Stadiumand the millions watching around the world during half-time.

Usher’s new album, Coming Home, will reportedly be released on February 11 – the same day as the Super Bowl.

Who won the Super Bowl in 2023?
Last year’s Super Bowl saw the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-35. Patrick Mahomes was named Super Bowl MVP.

Who will play in Super Bowl 2024?
The Super Bowl marks the conclusion of the NFL play-offs following the end of the 18-week regular season.
